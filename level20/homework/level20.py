# 1. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers.
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# def number(x):
#     even_sum = 0
#     for i in x(1, 10, 2):
#         if i % 2 == 0:
#           even_sum += 1
#         print(even_sum)

# sum(numbers)

# 2. Create a function that accepts a string and returns the string reversed without using any built-in reverse functions.

# 3. Implement a function that takes a number and returns the factorial of that number using recursion.

# 4. Design a function that accepts two lists and returns a list of common elements without using set operations.

# 5. Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.

# 6. Create a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the list sorted in ascending order without using built-in sort functions.

# 7. Implement a function that takes two strings and returns True if one string is a permutation of the other.

# 8. Write a function that accepts a matrix (list of lists) and returns its transpose.

# 9. Create a function that takes a number and returns True if it is a prime number.

# 10. Design a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a list with the strings sorted by their lengths.
